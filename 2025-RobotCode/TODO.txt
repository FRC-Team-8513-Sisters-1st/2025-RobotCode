- ToDo
    - Before Lehigh
        - LIMIT switch reset elevator
        - consume all getButtonPressed at teleop init
        - Tuning
            - reduce teleop score counter
            - make coral intake faster in auto
            - tune otf velocity and acceleration teleop
            - reduce OTF offset
            - graph OTF error and tune path following PID
            - investigate delay when autopathing in teleop

    - At Lehigh:
        - test reef offsets
        - test elevator heights
        - test coral station poses

    - backups and spares
        - flashed sd card for rio and Opi
        - bring pre imaged rio and oPi for quick swap

    - later 
        - elevator jam detection
        - climber states
