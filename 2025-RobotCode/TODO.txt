- ToDo
    - backups and spares
        - flashed sd card for rio and Opi
    - Coral velocity PID test
        - once factor is calcualted, then switch to PID velocity
        - tune PID velocity
    - Cameras
        - Add reef camera feeds to driver station
        - Figure out how to switch to climber camera feed at endgame
    - later 
        - elevator jam detection
        - climber states
- LIMIT switch
- tune otf velocity and acceleration teleop
- try to get 4 coral auto (reduce otf offset)
- tune path following PID
- delay when autopathing in teleop
- reduce score time
