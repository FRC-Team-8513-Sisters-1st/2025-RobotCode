- ToDo
    - due week 1
        - test coral out then in thing
        - try different (smaller) reef astar offset (path all the way to goal score pose)
            - note: if within 0.5m of goal pose, we cant OTF, need to AP
        - manual control and resets for elevator (joystick 4)
        - manual control for algae and coral mech (joystick 4 or more buttons)

        - test backup and elevator auto down after auto score
        - climber states
        - elevator jam detection 
        - change offsets for L1
        - infinite coral statiion auto to practice feeding
        - final tune navgrid using sim, check a few IRL

- Tuning:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
