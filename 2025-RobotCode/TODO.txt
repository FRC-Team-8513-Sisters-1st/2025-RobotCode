- ToDo
    - test
        - add delay in auto
        - tune OTF Final V and AP PID

    - due week 1 
        - in the "ready to score functions" in both auto and teleop we need to check our goal heading
            - once we add this check, the rotational PID may need to be made more aggressive to actually reach the goal
        - add comments to drivebase class

        - outake in 1st second of diving to cs

    - later 
        - elevator jam detection
        - climber states

- Tuning:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
