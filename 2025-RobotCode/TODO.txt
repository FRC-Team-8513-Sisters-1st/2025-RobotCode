- ToDo
    - due week 0
        In simulation
            - copy auto that works to make other autos

    - due week 1
        - feeder station poses rename from close far to left right
        - make generic "ready to auto score" function
        - improve elevator auto up
        - if copilot changes goal, reinitialize path
        
        - manual control and resets for elevator and other mechs
        - custom any auto
        - add backup and elevator auto down after auto score with 
        - climber states
        - elevator jam detection

- Tuning:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
