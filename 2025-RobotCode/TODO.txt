- ToDo
    - LEDs
        - make them turn on
        - make them solid red when we haven't seen reef tags in ~1 seconds
        - other colors to help driver know what state we are in
    - Cameras
        - Add reef camera feeds to driver station
        - Figure out how to switch to climber camera feed at endgame
    - test
        - Test new attack point distance PID
        - Test faster auto to determine if 3 piece works
    - later 
        - elevator jam detection
        - climber states

At Warren Hills:
- tune reef offsets
- tune elevator heights
- tune coral station 

- Tuning:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
