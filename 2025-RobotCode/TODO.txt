- ToDo
    - backups and spares
        - flashed sd card for rio and Opi
    - Coral velocity PID test
        - once factor is calcualted, then switch to PID velocity
        - tune PID velocity
    - consume all getButtonPressed at teleop init
    - Prep
        - bring pre imaged rio and oPi for quick swap
    - Cameras
        - Add reef camera feeds to driver station
    - later 
        - elevator jam detection
        - climber states
- LIMIT switch
- tune otf velocity and acceleration teleop
- try to get 4 coral auto (reduce otf offset)
- tune path following PID
- delay when autopathing in teleop
- reduce score time

At Lehigh:
- test reef offsets
- test elevator heights
- test coral station poses
