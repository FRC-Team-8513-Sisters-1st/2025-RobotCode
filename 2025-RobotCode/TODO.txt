- ToDo
    - test
        - when robot disabled use farther max AT distance and heading correction
        - manual coral outtake
        X manual control and resets for elevator (joystick 4)
        X manual control for algae and coral mech (joystick 4 or more buttons)
        X diagram for what joystick 4 buttons do
        - add more I to the AP Pid controllers, it took a few seconds to pull us in sometimes
        - do we need to pregenerate first path? is it waiting at the start of auto

    - due week 1 
        - in the "ready to score functions" in both auto and teleop we need to check our goal heading
            - once we add this check, the rotational PID may need to be made more aggressive to actually reach the goal
        - possibly reduce OTF final velocity, test how long autos take with and without it but it looks like its overshooting the paths
            - this may be a path following PID tuning issue
        - add comments to drivebase class

    - later 
        - elevator jam detection
        - climber states

- Tuning:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
