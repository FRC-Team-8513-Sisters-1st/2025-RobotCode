- ToDo
    - due week 0
        In simulation
            - manually made few autos
            - check elevator pos b4 auto scoring
            - get distance to goal pose instead of mid of reef
                - go over naming scheme to decide which ones we will make            

    - due week 1
        - elevator jam detection
        - update auto elveator detection
        - if copilot changes goal, reinitialize path
        - manual control and resets for elevator and other emchs
        - custom any auto

        - if holding RT or LT and scores for > 0.5 s
            - auto elevator back down after score
        - climber states

- Real Robot:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
