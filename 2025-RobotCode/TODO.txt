- ToDo
    - test
        - OTF tuning and AP tuning
        - tune OTF offsets
        - tune l1 offsets
        - tune cs offsets
        - tune tune elevator heights
        - during OTF auto, check if we have a coral, if we dont have one by AP, go to coral station
        - during auto, check if elevator is at right height before scoring
        - dont bring elevator down if close to reef 
            - not sure if we need to do this or not
        
    - due week 1 
        - update radio
        
        - manual control and resets for elevator (joystick 4)
        - manual control for algae and coral mech (joystick 4 or more buttons)
        - backup and elevator auto down after auto score

        - climber states
        - elevator jam detection


- Tuning:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
