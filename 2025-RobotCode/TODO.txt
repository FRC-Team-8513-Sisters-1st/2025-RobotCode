        - 0,0 origin is blue side, and its the standard
    - slow down paths
        - lets get paths working well at slow speeds before going too much faster
    - add logic classes
        - Auto
        - state machine
        - vision
        
    - Impliment path planning
        - Test a 1m straight path
            - tune for precision
        - test 1m out and back
            - tune for precision
        - straight while turning
        - driving in x and y 
    - Discuss controlability
    - Create state machine
    - Advantage scope layout

- Auto
    - Plan out each path in pathplanner
    - Auto selector
