- ToDo
    - Coral velocity PID test
        - once factor is calcualted, then switch to PID velocity
        - tune PID velocity
    - Cameras
        - Add reef camera feeds to driver station
        - Figure out how to switch to climber camera feed at endgame
    - later 
        - elevator jam detection
        - climber states

At Warren Hills:
- tune reef offsets
- tune elevator heights
- tune coral station poses
