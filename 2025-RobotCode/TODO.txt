- ToDo
    - due week 1
        - make generic "ready to auto score" function
        - improve elevator auto up
        - if copilot changes goal, reinitialize path
        
        - on path on fly, if start pose in reef zone, attak point backwards, then path to goal
        - manual control and resets for elevator (joystick 4)
        - manual control for algae and coral mech (joystick 4 or more buttons)

        - add backup and elevator auto down after auto score with 
        - climber states
        - elevator jam detection 

- Tuning:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
