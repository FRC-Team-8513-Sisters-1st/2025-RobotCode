- ToDo
    - test

    - due week 1 
        - simplify autos
            - some are impossible. we want a 222, 244, and 444 on each side.
        - need score 1 coral auto
        - in the "ready to score functions" in both auto and teleop we need to check our goal heading
            - once we add this check, the rotational PID may need to be made more aggressive to actually reach the goal
        - possibly reduce OTF final velocity, test how long autos take with and without it but it looks like its overshooting the paths
            - this may be a path following PID tuning issue
        - add comments to drivebase class
        - add delay in auto
        - outake in 1st second of diving to cs

    - later 
        - elevator jam detection
        - climber states

- Tuning:
    - Tune drivebase odometry without vision
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Tune attack point PID
    - speed up elevator
