- ToDo
    - use rotation joystick to have the robot face that angle 
    - force elevator state somehow (hold button? double tap?)
    - use path planner to set all poses in settings
    - put attackPose pose on smart dashbaord
    - put selected goal coral on dashbord
    - once button pannel is ready
        - test all state changes
        - test the updating of attack pose on smart dashbord
    - Turn off photon vision if in simulation
    - Generate path on fly

- Real robot:
    - figure out direction of each motor and setpoints
    - drivebase ratio and analog encoder offsets
    - tune elevator PID
    - Tune DB velocity PID
    - Tune path planning no feedback
    - Tune path planning position PID
    - Photon vision
    
- Auto
    - Plan out each path in pathplanner

- Teleop
    - Heading goal rather than rotation speed
